 * This function creates a connection for the concept connection system. This connection will only be created in real sense

 * Here id and ghostId are created which are negative(these are virtual ids). After they are synced then they become real ids
 * The real ids are then associated with these ghost ids in node server (backend) and also in the local memory.
 * @param ofTheConceptId Of the concept Id for the connection
 * @param toTheConceptId To the concept Id for the connection
 * @param typeId Type of the connection, should be the composition id for internal connection and type concept in case
 * of external connection.
 * @param orderId current context is that for internal connections the order id is less than 3 and for external connections greater than 999
 * @param typeString this is the typeString in the case of external connections.
 * @returns a connection that is created and stored in the local system.
