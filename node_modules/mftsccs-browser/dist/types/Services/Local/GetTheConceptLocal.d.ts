 * This function converts any local/ virtual or real concept id to a LConcept.
 * In case that the id is virtual then it tries to find it from the local memory. This will return -ve id.
 * In case that the virtual id has already been synced to the backend then it gets this from the relational binary tree(LocalGhostIdTree). This will return +ve id.
 * In case that we pass real id then this will return real concept but formatted in LConcept form. This might have undefined ghostId.
 * @param id the id that you want to find out the concept of. This could be a negative (virtual id ) or a real concept id.
 * @returns LConcept with either (-ve or +ve id)
